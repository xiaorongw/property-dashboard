## PropLocate Property Dashboard

A centralised visualisation platform for housing prices to enable more informed purchasing decisions. This dashboard aims to expand on the HDB map service and extend analysis to include both public and private properties. It serves to provide data analysis to enable buyers to analyse and compare housing prices based on different factors: time, location, housing type, town/district, and floor area.

Data visualisations include price trends, price overview across towns/districts and housing type, as well as geospatial mapping of prices and floor area.
